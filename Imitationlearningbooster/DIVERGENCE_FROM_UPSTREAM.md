# Divergence from Upstream (Humanoid-Goalkeeper)

This document tracks substantive changes where the Booster T1 adaptation deviates from the G1 tracking task pipeline.

## 2026-05-03 — Fully autonomous goalkeeper (no motion input at play time)

**Files:** 
- `my_mjlab_project/src/my_mjlab_project/mdp/resets.py` (new)
- `my_mjlab_project/src/my_mjlab_project/tasks/goalkeeper_env_cfg.py`

**What:** 
1. Created `reset_ball_autonomous()` - standalone ball reset function with no motion tracking dependency
2. Removed motion command entirely from play config
3. Added autonomous ball reset as startup event
4. Removed 6 motion-dependent reward + 3 motion-dependent termination terms

**Why:** The end goal is a **100% autonomous goalkeeper**:
- **Training:** Learn from all 6 motion types (left/right hand, jump, step) via RSI (RL + imitation)
- **Observations:** Ball position, ball velocity, joint state **only** (no motion in obs)
- **Play:** Policy autonomously chooses best response to any incoming ball

By removing the motion command, the policy receives no motion input at inference time. The autonomous reset function ensures the ball still gets randomized trajectories.

**Impact:** 
- Policy trained on diverse motion examples but is **completely autonomous at play time**
- No `--motion-file` argument needed
- Ball resets with random trajectory **on every episode reset** (3-5m away, random y/z, timed arc)
- Ball respawns when episode times out (5 seconds) or manual reset (press 'r' in viewer)
- Play command: `uv run python -m mjlab.scripts.play goalkeeper --checkpoint-file logs/.../model_N.pt`
- Play mode runs stably, policy reacts autonomously to ball motion

## 2026-05-02 — Remove motion-reference observations from actor/critic

**File:** `my_mjlab_project/src/my_mjlab_project/tasks/goalkeeper_env_cfg.py`

**What:** Removed `command`, `motion_anchor_pos_b`, `motion_anchor_ori_b` from
the actor and critic observation groups in `goalkeeper_env_cfg()`.

**Why:** The upstream G1 tracking task treats reference motion as an explicit
input to the policy. This requires a motion file at inference time. For an
autonomous goalkeeper agent that decides its own response based on ball
position, the motion reference must not appear in the observation space.
The 6 motion files are retained for RSI (reference state initialisation) and
style-shaping rewards during training only.

**Impact:** All checkpoints trained before 2026-05-02 are incompatible with the
new observation space (actor dim changed). Full retrain required.
